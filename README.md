# Dice_Game
That's great! A dice game website between 2 players is a fun and challenging project to build with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The basic functionality of the website would be to allow user to refresh the web page and  see who can get the highest score. 
Website will determine who is the winner player1 or player 2.


In future I will add more features in it, For example
1. Allow users to enter their names and Showing the name of winner on web page.
2. Instead of refreshing the web page players can play manually by clicking on buttons.
